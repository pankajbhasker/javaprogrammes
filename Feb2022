HashMap Internal implementation
6.ConcurrentHashMap ? internal implementation
7.Follow up question – 
we have 2 threads t1, t2, one is reading and other is updating the same ConcurrentHashMap, 
now how you will make sure that reader thread must get updated value?

4. Suppose we have Student class with properties “name” & “age” and we have implemented only hashCode() but not equals() methods. 
ow we created two objects e1, e2 with same property value “ABC”, 20 respectively. 
When we add them into HashMap then what will be the size of map?

5. Follow up question, We have one object named e1 with value “ABC”, 20. We have added that object into HashMap (map.put(e1,”value”)), 
now we change the value of name from “ABC” to “MNO” by e1.setName() and try to get the value by map.get(e1). Will it give “value” or null ?

Given a string, e.g. foobar, you want to get the list of all suffixes of said string, e.g. ["r", "ar", "bar", "obar", "oobar", "foobar"]
